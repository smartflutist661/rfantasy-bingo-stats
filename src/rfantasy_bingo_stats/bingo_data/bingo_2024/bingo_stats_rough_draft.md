# Preliminary Notes

Most of this post, and all of these statistics, were generated by a script I wrote, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/smartflutist661/rfantasy-bingo-stats),
Anyone is welcome to view the enhancments I currently have in mind, request new statistics, or contribute there.
You can find the raw data, corrected data, and some more extensive summary statistics at that link, as well.
See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/12gyb45/cleaning_2022_and_future_bingo_data/) for some technical details.

Format has been shamelessly copied from previous bingo stats posts:
  - [2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1cd0kdk/statistics_for_the_2023_rfantasy_bingo/)
  - [2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/12xs3c1/2022_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ude8f4/2021_rfantasy_bingo_stats/)
  - [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/npvigf/2020_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/gjq0ym/2019_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/bbm35a/2018_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/89esvx/2017_fantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/62sp9h/2016_fantasy_bingo_statistics/)

Likewise, the following notes are shamelessly adapted.

1. Stories were not examined for fitness. If you used **1984** for **Novella**, it was included in the statistics for that square.
In addition, if you did something like, say, put **The Lost Metal** as a short story, I made no effort to figure out where it actually belonged.
2. When a series was specified, it was collapsed to the first book. Graphic novels, light novels, manga, and webserials were collapsed from issues to the overall series.
3. Books by multiple authors were counted once for each author.
E.g.: **In the Heart of Darkness** by Eric Flint and David Drake counts as a read for both Eric Flint and David Drake.
*However*, books by a writing team with a single-author pseudonym, e.g. M.A. Carrick, were counted once for the pseudonym, and not for the authors behind the pseudonym.
4. Author demographic statistics are now included below. However, researching all 6149 individual authors
is quite an undertaking, and there is still a reasonable amount of information missing, especially regarding Nationality.
By the time next year's stats roll around I hope to have it reasonably complete.
5. Short stories were excluded from most of the stats below. They *were* included in the total story count.

# And Now: The Stats

As with books, most authors were read only once.

The following tables represent a best-effort attempt at a statistical breakdown of author demographics.
The "Overall %" column represents the _total_ number of times a demographic appeared in Bingo data,
i.e. Brandon Sanderson counts 908641 times for each of his demographic groups.
The "Unique %" column represents the unique number of times a demographic appeared in Bingo data,
i.e. Brandon Sanderson counts only once, no matter how many squares or cards he appears on.

Demographics representing less than 1% of the unique authors are not included in these tables.

## Variety

The FarraGini index, [introduced in 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/89esvx/2017_fantasy_bingo_statistics/) (see Part III),
attempts to measure the variety of books and authors read for each square.
Each entity's "income" for a square is the number of times it was used for that square,
so the index is analogous to its namesake, the [Gini index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient):

Values close to 0 suggest a square was well-varied; 0 means no book was repeated for a square.
Values close to 100 suggest the same books were used repeatedly for a square; 100 means only one book was used for a square.

## Year Over Year Changes

New this year: year-over-year statistics! For numbers from before 2022, I have scavenged from previous stats and data posts.

## Wall of Shame

Quoting the [very first bingo stats post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/62sp9h/2016_fantasy_bingo_statistics/),

> You are all terrible spellers.

A "misspelling" for the purposes of these statistics is any book (title/author combination)
that does not match the version used as the canonical version during cleaning.
There were a total of 3744 misspellings.
(Note that this does not include short stories.)

The books with the most variation in title or author spellings were:

- **This is How You Lose the Time War** by Amal El-Mohtar, Max Gladstone, with 27 variations
- TIE: **Never Whistle at Night** by Shane Hawk, Theodore C. Van Alst Jr. and **The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi** by S.A. Chakraborty, with 18 variations each
- **Vita Nostra** by Marina Dyachenko, Sergey Dyachenko, with 16 variations
- TIE: **Babel** by R.F. Kuang and **The Sword of Kaigen** by M.L. Wang, with 12 variations each
- **Chain-Gang All-Stars** by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, with 11 variations
- TIE: **Dungeon Crawler Carl** by Matt Dinniman and **Blood Over Bright Haven** by M.L. Wang and **The House in the Cerulean Sea** by T.J. Klune and **Mother of Learning** by Domagoj Kurmaić, with 10 variations each
- **A Wizard of Earthsea** by Ursula K. Le Guin, with 9 variations
- TIE: **The Spear Cuts Through Water** by Simon Jimenez and **Bookshops & Bonedust** by Travis Baldree and **Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries** by Heather Fawcett and **The Fifth Season** by N.K. Jemisin and **The Fellowship of the Ring** by J.R.R. Tolkien and **To Shape a Dragon's Breath** by Moniquill Blackgoose and **The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers and **Legends & Lattes** by Travis Baldree and **The Blacktongue Thief** by Christopher Buehlman and **The Goblin Emperor** by Katherine Addison, with 8 variations each
- TIE: **Starling House** by Alix E. Harrow and **She Who Became the Sun** by Shelley Parker-Chan and **A Master of Djinn** by P. Djèlí Clark and **Reign & Ruin** by J.D. Evans and **The Saint of Bright Doors** by Vajra Chandrasekera and **The Mask of Mirrors** by M.A. Carrick and **Orconomics** by J. Zachary Pike, with 7 variations each
- TIE: **Beware of Chicken** by CasualFarmer and **Annihilation** by Jeff VanderMeer and **The Dead Cat Tail Assassins** by P. Djèlí Clark and **The Deep** by Rivers Solomon and **The City of Brass** by S.A. Chakraborty and **Godkiller** by Hannah Kaner and **Space Opera** by Catherynne M. Valente and **The Poppy War** by R.F. Kuang and **Gideon the Ninth** by Tamsyn Muir, with 6 variations each

What makes a book hard to "spell" correctly?

- Length
- Lots of articles or prepositions
- Non-ASCII characters
- Lots of authors
- Numbers
- Somewhat obviously, books that were published under multiple titles

Predictably, there's a lot of crossover between books with the most variations and the most-read books overall.
