# Preliminary Notes

Most of this post, and all of these statistics, were generated by a script I wrote, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/smartflutist661/rfantasy-bingo-stats),
Anyone is welcome to view the enhancments I currently have in mind, request new statistics, or contribute there.
You can find the raw data, corrected data, and some more extensive summary statistics at that link, as well.
See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/12gyb45/cleaning_2022_and_future_bingo_data/) for some technical details.

Format has been shamelessly copied from previous bingo stats posts:
  - [2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1cd0kdk/statistics_for_the_2023_rfantasy_bingo/)
  - [2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/12xs3c1/2022_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ude8f4/2021_rfantasy_bingo_stats/)
  - [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/npvigf/2020_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/gjq0ym/2019_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/bbm35a/2018_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/89esvx/2017_fantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/62sp9h/2016_fantasy_bingo_statistics/)

Likewise, the following notes are shamelessly adapted.

1. Stories were not examined for fitness. If you used **1984** for **Novella**, it was included in the statistics for that square.
In addition, if you did something like, say, put **The Lost Metal** as a short story, I made no effort to figure out where it actually belonged.
2. When a series was specified, it was collapsed to the first book. Graphic novels, light novels, manga, and webserials were collapsed from issues to the overall series.
3. Books by multiple authors were counted once for each author.
E.g.: **In the Heart of Darkness** by Eric Flint and David Drake counts as a read for both Eric Flint and David Drake.
*However*, books by a writing team with a single-author pseudonym, e.g. M.A. Carrick, were counted once for the pseudonym, and not for the authors behind the pseudonym.
4. Author demographic statistics are now included below. However, researching all 6624 individual authors
is quite an undertaking, and there is still a reasonable amount of information missing, especially regarding Nationality.
By the time next year's stats roll around I hope to have it reasonably complete.
5. Short stories were excluded from most of the stats below. They *were* included in the total story count.

# And Now: The Stats

As with books, most authors were read only once.

The following tables represent a best-effort attempt at a statistical breakdown of author demographics.
The "Overall %" column represents the _total_ number of times a demographic appeared in Bingo data,
i.e. Brandon Sanderson counts 256022 times for each of his demographic groups.
The "Unique %" column represents the unique number of times a demographic appeared in Bingo data,
i.e. Brandon Sanderson counts only once, no matter how many squares or cards he appears on.

Demographics representing less than 1% of the unique authors are not included in these tables.

## Variety

The FarraGini index, [introduced in 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/89esvx/2017_fantasy_bingo_statistics/) (see Part III),
attempts to measure the variety of books and authors read for each square.
Each entity's "income" for a square is the number of times it was used for that square,
so the index is analogous to its namesake, the [Gini index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient):

Values close to 0 suggest a square was well-varied; 0 means no book was repeated for a square.
Values close to 100 suggest the same books were used repeatedly for a square; 100 means only one book was used for a square.

## Year Over Year Changes

New this year: year-over-year statistics! For numbers from before 2022, I have scavenged from previous stats and data posts.

<INSERT PLOTS HERE>

## Wall of Shame

Quoting the [very first bingo stats post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/62sp9h/2016_fantasy_bingo_statistics/),

> You are all terrible spellers.

A "misspelling" for the purposes of these statistics is any book (title/author combination)
that does not match the version used as the canonical version during cleaning.
There were a total of 3180 misspellings.
(Note that this does not include short stories.)

The books with the most variation in title or author spellings were:

- **This is How You Lose the Time War** by Amal El-Mohtar, Max Gladstone, with 26 variations
- **The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi** by S.A. Chakraborty, with 17 variations
- **Never Whistle at Night** by Shane Hawk, Theodore C. Van Alst Jr., with 13 variations
- **The Sword of Kaigen** by M.L. Wang, with 12 variations
- TIE: **Vita Nostra** by Marina Dyachenko, Sergey Dyachenko and **Babel** by R.F. Kuang and **Chain-Gang All-Stars** by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, with 10 variations each
- **Mother of Learning** by Domagoj Kurmaić, with 9 variations
- TIE: **Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries** by Heather Fawcett and **The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers and **Blood Over Bright Haven** by M.L. Wang and **The House in the Cerulean Sea** by T.J. Klune and **A Wizard of Earthsea** by Ursula K. Le Guin, with 8 variations each
- TIE: **The Fellowship of the Ring** by J.R.R. Tolkien and **Legends & Lattes** by Travis Baldree, with 7 variations each
- TIE: **Starling House** by Alix E. Harrow and **Bookshops & Bonedust** by Travis Baldree and **Beware of Chicken** by CasualFarmer and **The Fifth Season** by N.K. Jemisin and **Godkiller** by Hannah Kaner, with 6 variations each
- TIE: **The Spear Cuts Through Water** by Simon Jimenez and **The Liar's Knot** by M.A. Carrick and **The Atlas Six** by Olivie Blake and **She Who Became the Sun** by Shelley Parker-Chan and **The Lathe of Heaven** by Ursula K. Le Guin and **Dungeon Crawler Carl** by Matt Dinniman and **The Blacktongue Thief** by Christopher Buehlman and **Leviathan Wakes** by James S.A. Corey and **Even Though I Knew the End** by C.L. Polk and **Space Opera** by Catherynne M. Valente and **A Master of Djinn** by P. Djèlí Clark and **The Poppy War** by R.F. Kuang and **A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking** by T. Kingfisher and **Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City** by K.J. Parker and **Monstress** by Marjorie M. Liu, Sana Takeda and **We Are Legion (We Are Bob)** by Dennis E. Taylor and **The Unbroken** by C.L. Clark and **The Hobbit** by J.R.R. Tolkien and **Gideon the Ninth** by Tamsyn Muir and **Orconomics** by J. Zachary Pike and **The Mask of Mirrors** by M.A. Carrick and **Good Omens** by Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett and **Gods of the Wyrdwood** by R.J. Barker, with 5 variations each

What makes a book hard to "spell" correctly?

- Length
- Lots of articles or prepositions
- Non-ASCII characters
- Lots of authors
- Numbers
- Somewhat obviously, books that were published under multiple titles

Predictably, there's a lot of crossover between books with the most variations and the most-read books overall.
