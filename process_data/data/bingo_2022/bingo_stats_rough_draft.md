# Preliminary Notes

Most of this post, and all of these statistics, were generated by a script I wrote, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/smartflutist661/rfantasy-bingo-stats).
Anyone is welcome to contribute there. You can find the raw data, corrected data, and some more extensive summary statistics at that link, as well.
See my [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/12gyb45/cleaning_2022_and_future_bingo_data/) for some technical details.

Format has been shamelessly copied from previous bingo stats posts:

  - [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ude8f4/2021_rfantasy_bingo_stats/)
  - [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/npvigf/2020_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/gjq0ym/2019_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/bbm35a/2018_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/89esvx/2017_fantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/62sp9h/2016_fantasy_bingo_statistics/)

Likewise, the following notes are shamelessly adapted.

1. Stories were not examined for fitness. If you used **All That's Left in the World** for **No Ifs, Ands, or Buts**, it was included in the statistics for that square.
In addition, if you did something like, say, put **Spinning Silver** as a short story, I made no effort to figure out where it actually belonged.
2. Series were collapsed to their first book. Graphic novels, light novels, manga, and webserials were collapsed from issues to the overall series.
3. Books by multiple authors were counted once for each author. E.g.: **In the Heart of Darkness** by Eric Flint and David Drake counts as a read for both Eric Flint and David Drake.
*However*, books by a writing team with a single-author pseudonym, e.g. M.A. Carrick, were counted once for the pseudonym, and not for the authors behind the pseudonym.
4. Author demographic statistics are not included below, for two reasons: it quickly gets messy and culturally-specific,
and I didn't want to stalk all 3340 individual authors. Machinery for these calculations are included in the script, however,
so if anyone would like to supply demographic information, it is easy to include. (I may scrape author genders from past data, as well.)
5. Short stories were excluded from most of the stats below. They *were* included in the total story count.

# And Now: The Stats
    
## Overall Stats

### Squares and Cards

- There were 822 cards submitted, 96 of which were incomplete.
The minimum number of filled squares was 2. 6 were *this close*, with 24 filled squares.
866 squares were left blank, leaving 19684 filled squares.
- There were 20140 total stories, with 5610 unique stories read,
by 3340 unique authors.
- The top three squares left blank were: **Set in Africa**, blank on 66 cards; **Five Short Stories**, blank on 53 cards; **Self-Published**, blank on 51 cards. On the other hand, **Stand-alone** was only left blank 19 times.
- The three squares most often substituted were: **Self-Published**, substituted on 29 cards; **Set in Africa**, substituted on 26 cards; **Book Club or Readalong Book** and **Two or More Authors**, substituted on 21 cards each. **Non-Human Protagonist** and **No Ifs, Ands, or Buts** were never subsituted.
This means that Set in Africa was the least favorite overall, skipped or substituted a total of 92 times.
- There were an average of 4.2 unique books per card.
- 152 cards claimed an all-hard-mode card, while 15 cards were short by one square.
