# Preliminary Notes

Most of this post, and all of these statistics, were generated by a script I wrote, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/smartflutist661/rfantasy-bingo-stats).
Anyone is welcome to contribute there. The raw data is also available.

Format has been shamelessly copied from u/FarragutCircle's previous bingo stats:

  * [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/npvigf/2020_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  * [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/gjq0ym/2019_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  * [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/bbm35a/2018_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  * [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/89esvx/2017_fantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  * [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/62sp9h/2016_fantasy_bingo_statistics/)

Likewise, the following notes are shamelessly adapted.

1. Stories were not examined for fitness. If you used **All That's Left in the World** for **No Ifs, Ands, or Buts**, it was included in the statistics for that square.
In addition, if you did something like, say, put **Spinning Silver** as a short story, I made no effort to figure out where it actually belonged.
2. Series were collapsed to their first book. Graphic novels, light novels, manga, and webserials were collapsed from issues to the overall series.

# And Now: The Stats
