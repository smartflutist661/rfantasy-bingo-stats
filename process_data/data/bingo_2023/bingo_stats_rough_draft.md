# Preliminary Notes

Most of this post, and all of these statistics, were generated by a script I wrote, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/smartflutist661/rfantasy-bingo-stats),
Anyone is welcome to view the enhancments I currently have in mind, request new statistics, or contribute there.
You can find the raw data, corrected data, and some more extensive summary statistics at that link, as well.
See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/12gyb45/cleaning_2022_and_future_bingo_data/) for some technical details.

Format has been shamelessly copied from previous bingo stats posts:

  - [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ude8f4/2021_rfantasy_bingo_stats/)
  - [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/npvigf/2020_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)

  - [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/bbm35a/2018_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/89esvx/2017_fantasy_bingo_statistics/)
  - [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/62sp9h/2016_fantasy_bingo_statistics/)

Likewise, the following notes are shamelessly adapted.

1. Stories were not examined for fitness. If you used **1984** for **Novella**, it was included in the statistics for that square.
In addition, if you did something like, say, put **The Lost Metal** as a short story, I made no effort to figure out where it actually belonged.
2. When a series was specified, it was collapsed to the first book. Graphic novels, light novels, manga, and webserials were collapsed from issues to the overall series.
3. Books by multiple authors were counted once for each author. E.g.: **In the Heart of Darkness** by Eric Flint and David Drake counts as a read for both Eric Flint and David Drake.
*However*, books by a writing team with a single-author pseudonym, e.g. M.A. Carrick, were counted once for the pseudonym, and not for the authors behind the pseudonym.
4. Author demographic statistics are not included below, for two reasons: it quickly gets messy and culturally-specific,
and I didn't want to stalk all 3934 individual authors. Machinery for these calculations are included in the script, however,
so if anyone would like to supply demographic information, it is easy to include.
5. Short stories were excluded from most of the stats below. They *were* included in the total story count.

# And Now: The Stats

## Variety

The FarraGini index, [introduced in 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/89esvx/2017_fantasy_bingo_statistics/) (see Part III),
attempts to measure the variety of books and authors read for each square.
Each entity's "income" for a square is the number of times it was used for that square,
so the index is analogous to its namesake, the [Gini index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient):

Values close to 0 suggest a square was well-varied; 0 means no book was repeated for a square.
Values close to 100 suggest the same books were used repeatedly for a square; 100 means only one book was used for a square.

## Wall of Shame

Quoting the [very first bingo stats post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/62sp9h/2016_fantasy_bingo_statistics/),

> You are all terrible spellers.

A "misspelling" for the purposes of these statistics is any book (title/author combination)
that does not match the version used as the canonical version during cleaning.
There were a total of 5859 misspellings.
(Note that this does not include short stories.)

The books with the most variation in title or author spellings were:

- **This is How You Lose the Time War** by Amal El-Mohtar, Max Gladstone, with 40 variations
- **The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi** by S.A. Chakraborty, with 39 variations
- **All Systems Red** by Martha Wells, with 23 variations
- **Good Omens** by Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, with 21 variations
- **A Wizard of Earthsea** by Ursula K. Le Guin, with 19 variations
- TIE: **The Frugal Wizard's Handbook for Surviving Medieval England** by Brandon Sanderson and **Avatar: The Rise of Kyoshi** by F.C. Yee, Michael Dante DiMartino, with 18 variations each
- **Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries** by Heather Fawcett, with 17 variations
- TIE: **Legends & Lattes** by Travis Baldree and **A Psalm for the Wild-Built** by Becky Chambers, with 16 variations each
- **One Piece** by Eiichiro Oda, with 15 variations
- TIE: **The Druid's Call** by E.K. Johnston and **A Master of Djinn** by P. Djèlí Clark and **Lore Olympus** by Rachel Smythe and **Silver in the Wood** by Emily Tesh, with 13 variations each

What makes a book hard to "spell" correctly?

- Length
- Lots of articles or prepositions
- Non-ASCII characters
- Lots of authors
- Numbers
- Somewhat obviously, books that were published under multiple titles

Predictably, there's a lot of crossover between books with the most variations and the most-read books overall.

## Year Over Year Changes

New this year: year-over-year statistics! For numbers from before 2022, I have scavenged from previous stats and data posts.
